# Pipeline Library for the SAP Cloud SDK


## Description

 This pipeline library is used by [SAP Cloud SDK Pipeline](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-pipeline).
 It defines the common steps (functions) in a Jenkins pipeline to build, test and deploy applications to the SAP Cloud Platform.

 ## Requirements

 To use the pipeline library you must have a git project which uses a pipeline, such as the [SAP Cloud SDK Pipeline](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-pipeline).

 ## Download and Installation

 To use the library in a pipeline you have to configure this library as a [globally shared library](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/).

 To avoid the manual steps described in that documentation you can use the SAP Cloud SDK Cx Server.

 For instantiating the SAP Cloud SDK Cx Server, you need to provide a suitable host with a Linux operating system and Docker installed. Please also ensure that the user with whom you start the Cx Server belongs to the [docker group](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/linux-postinstall/).

 Your project source files need to be available on a git or GitHub server, which is accessible from the Cx Server host.

 The lifecycle of the Cx Server is maintained by a script called `cx-server`.
 It can be found in the same named folder on the root of each SAP Cloud SDK project archetype. Together with the `server.cfg` file, this is all you need for starting your instance of the SAP Cloud SDK Cx Server.

 To create a new project using the SDK execute the following command:

 ```shell
  mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=com.sap.cloud.sdk.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=scp-cf-tomee -DarchetypeVersion=RELEASE

 ```

 In the new project, there is a folder called `cx-server`.
 This folder needs to be copied to the future host on which the Cx Server is intended to run.

 On the host machine execute the following command in the folder `cx-server`.
 This will start the Jenkins server.
 ```shell
  ./cx-server start
 ```

 In Jenkins click on "New Item" and create a new "Multibranch Pipeline" for your repository.

 Now you can use the pipeline in a `Jenkinsfile` by adding the following line on top of the file.
  ```shell
 @Library(['s4sdk-pipeline-library']) _
  ```

 If you decide for [SAP Cloud SDK Pipeline](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-pipeline), this is already done for you.
